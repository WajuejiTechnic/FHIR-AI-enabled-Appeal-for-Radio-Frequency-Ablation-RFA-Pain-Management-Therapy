This web application is designed to make appealing insurance company denials 
easy, while also scanning medical journals to back the appeal with medical
studies. 

Using the application is fairly straightforward. On the main landing page, the 
user will see a list of patients that have been diagnosed with low back pain. 
To start an appeal, the user will click on the `Appeal` button located in the 
rightmost column. 

On the `Edit Information` panel the user will find various pieces of information
about the patient, such as Date of Birth and Gender. On this page, the user will
fill in information about the patient, such as any notes that will be relevant
to the appeal process.

On the `Draft Appeal` page, the user will be given an editable appeal letter,
filled in with the patient's information and exceprts from medical journals 
supporting the appeal. If the user decides that any of the information is not
relevant, then it can simply be removed at this stage.

The `Submit Appeal` page allows the user one last look at the appeal letter 
before submitting it to the insurance company.
